# GS1 Digital Link URI Verifier for EPCIS

### Purpose of this Jupyter Notebook
* Basis for discussion in EPCIS/CBV 2.0 MSWG
* Potential starting point of an open source artefact to help in applying constrained GS1 Digital Link URIs for populating EPCIS events 

### Functionality
* Checks whether a list of GS1 DL URIs conforms to the constrained syntax as defined in CBV 2.0
* Specifically:
 * checks if GS1 DL URIs only comprise the primary identifier at the lowest, i.e. most precise level so that they correspond to the EPC URI/EPC Class URI schemes as defined in the EPC Tag Data Standard
 * accepts any user domain/sub-domain (i.e. not just canonical GS1 DL URIs)
 * checks that if a GS1 DL URI includes a GTIN, the latter is represented in its 14-digit format so that it is consistent with the definition of GS1 Application Identifier '01' 
* Input: list of Digital Link URIs (as they are intended to populate the epcList/quantityList)
* Output: dictionary (JSON object) which contains, for all entries of the input list, key-value pairs with the contained GS1 DL URIs and a corresponding Boolean value - either 'True' (if conformant) or 'false' (if not)
* Supported instance-level keys/compound keys: 
  * SSCC 
  * GTIN + Serial (SGTIN)
  * UPUI
  * GDTI with serial
  * SGCN with serial
  * GINC
  * GSIN 
  * GRAI
  * GIAI
  * ITIP
  * CPI
  * GSRN
  * GSRNP
* Supported class-level keys/compound keys: 
  * GTIN
  * GTIN + Lot (LGTIN)
  * GDTI without serial
  * SGCN without serial
  * GRAI without serial 
  * CPI without serial
* Supported location/party keys:
  * GLN with extension
  * GLN without extension
  * Party GLN
* Cases covered through invalid examples (i.e. those returning 'False'):
  * GTIN not formatted as GTIN-14 (i.e. corresponding to definition of GS1 Application Identifier (AI) '01')
  * Applying short names instead of AI equivalents
  * GTIN-based GS1 DL URI comprising consumer product variant (AI '22') 
  * GTIN-based GS1 DL URI comprising lot (AI 10) AND serial (AI 21) as key qualifiers (note: only one is allowed at a time)
  * Containing characters that need to be percent-encoded 
  * Ending with a trailing slash 
  * AI equivalents in the query string
  * Custom extensions in the query string
  * Comprising non-existent AIs
  * Data payload (e.g. serial number) exceeding character limit as defined per GS1 General Specifications
  * Empty fields (e.g. batch number or serial number without content)
  * Lacking a domain name
  * Containing space characters
  * Class-level (instead of instance-level) ID and vice versa

### Status
DRAFT (for discussion purposes)

### Notes and references 
* For the normative Regular Expressions, please refer to the CBV 2.0 standard, available at [https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis]. 
* Regular Expressions are not identical in all programming languages. In this context, this Jupyter Notebook [https://jupyter.org] is based on Python [https://www.python.org/] and makes use of some simplifications enabled by Python's regular expressions ('re') module [https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html], e.g. RegEx annotations and raw string notation for better readability and comprehensibility.
* Further, it makes use of metacharacters ('\d' instead of '0-9' and '\w' instead of 'a-zA-Z0-9_') for the sake of brevity.
